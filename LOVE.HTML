    <h1>WELL MAINE LIKHA KAAFI RAW THA YEH PITCH ISILOYE KAAFI MAZAK TYPE KA HAI, BUT DIL SAI HAI (I LOVE U) AND OFCOURSE TUMNAI ISSAI PADHA VA HAI</h1>
    <p class="large-paragraph">
        MY NAME IS HARSHIT AND HERE I AM TO MAKE A PITCH  TO  CONVINCE YOU WHY YOU SHOULD LOVE ME

        BEFORE STARING, FIRST TELL ME WHAT IS LOVE 
        The definition says that LOVE IS AN EMOTION WHICH  encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. 
        
        
        Well if you ask me personally, love is the beautiful state of being an emotional fool for someone, where their presence brings immense joy, comfort, and a sense of being completely at ease. It's a feeling that allows you to be unapologetically goofy, to open up your heart and soul without hesitation, and to willingly cross boundaries for the sake of that person's happiness and well-being.
    </p>
    <P>
        So before being in love you have to find the correct person to love cause if you dont things will get so ugly that you gonna start liking kabir singh and tera naam type movies or even saath nibhana sathiya.


Hey Anu, guess who's here to make you an offer you can't refuse? That's right, it's me! Now, when it comes to picking the perfect partner, it's like choosing the right flavor of ice creamâ€”you gotta taste a few scoops before you find the one that really tickles your taste buds. So, how do you know if someone's the real deal? Simple, my friend: it's all about time. The more time you spend getting to know someone, the less likely you are to end up with a dud


And well we are besties since the time your periods have not even started, so you have actually seen you  grown up to a wonderful individual I am now.(ab mai itna bhi kuch khass nahi).
    </P>

       In any relationship, it's essential to have a blend of spice,some argument, fun, romance, and, most importantly, trust.

I am the package which can provide all the esence
 Spice - Trust me babes, if we remove the distance we would have so much spice in our relationship ki humai ho sakti hai,I mean you are half cracked I am half cracked, our combination will be dangerous. Dekho first tumhai jooth bolna nahi ata aur mujhe ata hai (yeh deadly combination ekdum),hum dono ko ghumna bahut pasand hai , hum dono last tak sochtai rehtai hai kaha jayenge, dono ko aise wil kissing ka shauk hai, i hope samjh rahi ho na kitna deadly hai

    </P>
    <P>
     argument - hum dono kai vichar aadhe milte hi nahi hai fight toh aise honge ki bas khatam but humari saari fight ek dusrai ko naked kiss kar kai khatam hogi aur tum mere godi mai hogiiii
 fun - you want fun just tell me which type of fun , movie night ko pillow fight mai convert karna ho,cook kartai kartai ek dusrai ko ata mai bhar dena hai , bitching karna hai kisi ka bhi , truth and dare kehlna ho , saath mai baith kai shinchan dekhna hai, ya kisi dur pahad kai trip mai jana hai(vo baat alag hai yeh abhi tak hua nahi lekin hog) yeh saari service aapko harshit bahety kai godi mai mil jayegiiii
 romance - I love you anuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,
I know tumnai count nahi kiya hoga kitna u , mera love bhi tumhare liye vaisa hi hai uncountable.
I love you is now old ab mai kehta hu tu budhu hai  is my new love language. and tum meri budddhu huuuuuuuu.
(bonus - sex and orgasmmmm)  aur vaise bhi last 1 year ka romantic portfolio is not badddddd
    </P>
    <P>
        trust - See I am very simple guy you say something to me aur mai ussai bhul jata hu but mai bhulta nahi hu for eg tumnai mujhe kuch kaha aur vohi chiz jab tak tum mujhsai vapas nahi puchti, bich mai vo chiz mere dimag sai  gayab. So when it comes to gossip and baatein vo toh kahi nahi jayegi,

aur last  year tumnai mere upar kala jaadu  kar diya hai ab mai tumhara alawa kisi kai sang nahi aah sakta toh so u know cheating ka bhi option gaya bolo kya aisa bandha dundhnai par bhi milega?aur trust me mai kaafi aalsi hu ki mai kisi aur ko patau (tumhara kala jaadu ka asar) 


aur pagli tum toh meri jaaannnnnnnnn ho babessssssss


and anu i guess we are naked enough to trust each other(mujhe golu molu chaiye varna mai cry kar dunga bas)
 kaha milega itna simple pyara trust worthy insaan, (pichle janam mai tumnai kuch acha kaam kiya hoga tabhi tumhai mai mila huuu)


In the end all I want to sai is ki haa bol rahi hai ya gunde bhej kar uthvau tujhe???


I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU MERI BABY GIRL
DO YOU LOVE ME???????
